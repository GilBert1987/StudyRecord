Gollum is a simple wiki system built on top of Git. A Gollum Wiki is simply a git repository (either bare or regular) of a specific nature:

1. A Gollum repository's contents are human-editable, unless the repository is bare. 
2. Pages are unique text files which may be organized into directories any way you choose. 
3. Other content can also be included, for example images, PDFs and headers/footers for your pages.
